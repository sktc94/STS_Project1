Our mission is to foster creative innovators by trans-disciplinary education integrating humanities, art, and technology, transcending boundaries of traditional education. Students learn to develop Humanities-based Imagination, Artistic Sensibility, and Media technology literacy as they play, collaborate, and create. Through our Learning by doing education, Whole brain education, and Global education, Art & Technology alumni will lead the global creative industry with distinctive integrative knowledges and skills.
Learning by Doing
Our education is based on project-based and self-directed learning model. This approach allows students to learn not only academic knowledges but also problem solving skills. Most projects are connected to real world problems in current creative industries, and in the process of self-directed group projects, students develop collaborative skills and leadership.
Education for the Whole Brain
We provide creative trans-disciplinary educational environment that integrates humanities, art, and technology. In the Left-Right brain integrative courses, students learn to plan, design, and implement their ideas suited for creative industry. We constantly challenge students to imagine, design and implement, and we believe during the process innovative solutions that will propel our society are being created.
Global Education
To prepare students to compete on the world stage, our courses are offered in English. In association with various foreign universities, the department provides student exchange programs, global seminars, projects and workshops offering students opportunities to work internationally and become a global leader.
